# Kafka Connect sink connector for JDBC

kafka-connect-jdbc-sink is a [Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) sink connector for copying data from Apache Kafka into a JDBC database.

The connector is supplied as source code which you can easily build into a JAR file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git@github.com:ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-jdbc-sink.git
```

2. Change directory to the `kafka-connect-jdbc-sink` directory:

```shell
cd kafka-connect-jdbc-sink
```

3. Build the connector using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```


4. Setup a local zookeeper service running on port 2181 (default) 

5. Setup a local kafka service running on port 9092 (default)

6. Setup a local rabbitmq service running on port 15672 (default)

7. Copy the compiled jar file into the `/usr/local/share/java/` directory:

```bash
cp target/kafka-connect-jdbc-sink-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /usr/local/share/java/
```

8. Copy the `connect-standalone.properties` and `jdbc-sink.properties` files into the `/usr/local/etc/kafka/` directory. Note that for Db2 LUW 11.5.9 or later, one can use `insert.function.value=memory_table` in `jdbc-sink.properties` to insert rows using the SYSPROC.MEMORY_TABLE function instead of an INSERT with the input batch of rows.

```bash
cp config/* /usr/local/etc/kafka/
```

9. Go to the kafka installation directory `/usr/local/etc/kafka/`:

```bash
cd /usr/local/etc/kafka/
```

10. Set the CLASSPATH value to `/usr/local/share/java/` as follows:

```bash
export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/share/java/
```

## Configuration

1. Create a target kafka topic named `kafka_test`:

```shell
kafka-topics --create --topic kafka_test --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1 --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
```

2. Set up a JDBC database with an accessible URL and Port Number as well as a user with read/write privileges.

Setting up this database involves creating the database, creating user with password and proper access privileges.

Below are some of the commands involved in setting up databases using postgresql:

```bash
create user {username};
create database {dbname};
grant all privileges on database {dbname} to {username};

\l - list databse
\du is to verify user roles
\c to select database
```

Below are some of the commands involved in setting up databases using db2 using a docker image:

```bash
1. docker network create DB2net
2. mkdir db2
3. cd db2
4. docker run -it -d --name mydb2 --privileged=true -p 50000:50000 -e LICENSE=accept -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=<Access Password> -e DBNAME=db2 -v "$PWD":/database --network DB2net ibmcom/db2
5. docker logs -f mydb2
	# make sure all 4 tasks are completed and
	# (*) All databases are now active
6. docker exec -it mydb2 bash -c "su - db2inst1"
7. db2
8. create db kafka_test
9. connect to kafka_test
10. list tables
11. select * from company
```

Download the dc2jcc.jar file from the following url: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/db2-jdbc-driver-versions-and-downloads and place it into the jar classpath `/usr/local/share/java/`.


3. Open up the `config\jdbc-connector.json` file using the command below:

```bash
vi config\jdbc-connector.json
```

4. Set the following values in the `config\jdbc-connector.json` file:

```bash
    "connection.url": <CONNECTION_URL_OF_YOUR_DATABASE>,   (ie: "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/postgres")
    "connection.user": <CONNECTION_USER>,                  (ie: "newuser")
    "connection.password": <CONNECTION_PASSWORD>,          (ie: "test")
    "table.name.format": <DATABASE_TABLE_NAME>             (ie: "company")
```

## Running in Standalone Mode

Run the following command to start the sink connector service in standalone mode:

```bash
connect-standalone connect-standalone.properties jdbc-sink.properties
```

## Running in Distributed Mode

1. In order to run the connector in distributed mode you must first register the connector with
Kafka Connect service by creating a JSON file in the format below:

```json
{
  "name": "jdbc-sink-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.jdbcsink.JDBCSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "kafka_test",
    "connection.url": "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/postgres",
    "connection.user": "newuser",
    "connection.password": "test",
    "connection.ds.pool.size": 5,
    "insert.mode.databaselevel": true,
    "table.name.format": "company"
  }
}
```

A version of this file, `config/jdbc-connector.json`, is located in the `config` directory.  To register
the connector do the following:

1. Run the following command to the start the source connector service in distributed mode:

```bash
connect-distributed connect-distributed.properties
```

2. Run the following command to register the connector with the Kafka Connect service:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @config/jdbc-connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

You can verify that your connector was properly registered by going to `http://localhost:8083/connectors` which 
should return a full list of available connectors.  This JSON connector profile will be propegated to all workers
across the distributed system.  After following these steps your connector will now run in distributed mode.

## Testing

1. Run a kafka producer using the following value.schema by entering the following command:

```shell
kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic kafka_test
```

The console producer will now wait for the output.

2. Copy the following record into the producer terminal:

```shell
{"schema": {"type": "struct","fields": [{"type": "string","optional": false,"field": "Name"}, {"type": "string","optional": false,"field": "company"}],"optional": false,"name": "Person"},"payload": {"Name": "Roy Jones","company": "General Motors"}}
```

3. Open up the command-line client of your JDBC database and verify that a record has been added into the target database table.
If the database table did not exist prior to this, it would have been created by this process.

Be sure to target the proper database by using `\c <database_name>` or `USE <database_name>;`.

```sql
select * from company;
```

4. You should be able to see your newly created record added to this database table as follows:

```
 id |   timestamp   |   name    |    company     
----+------+---------------+-----------+----------------
  1 | 1587969949600 | Roy Jones |  General Motors
```
